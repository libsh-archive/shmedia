A cubemap of the animation room in the University of Waterloo Computer
Graphics Lab. Note that the stitching does not even pretend to be
correct. At some point I hope to make a better-stitched version of
these images.

These photos were taken by Stefanus Du Toit using a Canon EOS D30
digital camera.
