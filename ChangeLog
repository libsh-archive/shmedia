	* objs/src/teapot.cc: Teapot generation changed to
	fix singularity problems, lid enlarged to fill gaps,
	and texture coordinate generation modes added.

	* objs/teapot.obj: Original teapot model with problems
	fixed. Texture coordinates are [0, 1] for each individual
	patch.

	* objs/teapot2.obj: Texture coordinates span across several
	patches such that each part (i.e body, bottom, lid, handle
	and spout) shares a global parameterization.

	* objs/teapot3.obj: Similiar to teapot2.obj but the texture
	coordinates loop from 0 -> 1 -> 0 so that many of the
	seams/discontinuities are hidden.

	* objs/sg04.obj: Added SIGGRAPH 2004 logo.

	* horizonmaps/: Recomputed some horizon maps with smaller bumps.

	* horizonmaps/: Added some texture files used for horizon mapping.

2004-03-24  Michael McCool  <mmccool@uwaterloo.ca>

	* bumpmaps/: Added a simple bump map and an associated normal map
	* brdfs/: Imported more factorized brdfs from brdfview
	* mats/: Imported a number of alpha mat/material maps from brdfview

	* objs/s.obj: Added this model for the Sh Logo.
